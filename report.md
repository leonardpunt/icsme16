# Report 

This track was run as an experiment in open reviewing. 
As this community debates different forms of publication, we felt it timely to experiment with different kinds of 
reviewing models. Accordingly, Github and Google Docs was used for the submission process and all submissions were 
stored and reviewed within Github.  

This document is a   technical report on the lessons learned as part of that process.
